						<p>Hi, nice to meet ya, the names Rafeeq.<br><br>

						Im obsessed with design, I make it a constant practice even in my leisure time just for fun, but dont get me wrong I take my work very serious with hopes to make my passion a full-time job one day. I finished highschool at Cedar High School of Arts where I learned some fundamentals in visual art which I enjoyed learning, but unfortunately this was only for 2 years, but this was the start of my journey carving my way in the Career field of design.<br><br>
						
						
						When I was young my dream was to become a game developer, my facination of video games inspired me to practice things like drawing, painting, reading books on anatomy etc. I evetually got lost in all the research and college work, but spontaineously I realised what I love doing is design instead of art which two completely different topics. I started college in 2019 but studied something completely different from what my passion is which is ironic to many people, but this is once again due to unfortunate events. I studied finance economics and accounting for 3 years and worked a part-time job to earn abit of extra cash to invest into my side hussle which is painting/customising sneakers which is a growing market and a good way to keep your design and art skills in practice, people loved this skill yet it was very time consuming. While on college I continued to practice my passion in my leisure time and learned numerous ways to invest into a profitable business just using my skill.<br><br>
						
						
						So even while studying business I still kept my dreams close by making it a constant practice, even though I was making some extra cash on the side I knew I had upskill and then I started researching web design and doing short online courses on building websites with ShawAcademy, this course however I was unable to complete because of lack of time but just with the bit of knowledge I gained I understood how to build a website, well a basic website. After successfully graduating college in 2021 I continued to upskill my knowledge of computers and software by doing an ICT Course with CapaCiti where I learned basic computer fundamentals like hardware, software, networks and gained some additional knowledge on cloud computing and did an online datacentre technician course with AWS.<br><br>
						
						
						I am now currently working at "Younglings.Africa" as an intern practicing web develoment.</p></div>
